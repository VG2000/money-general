# The Money Myth

A presentation challenging what we're told about public finances, explaining how money creation actually works in the UK economy.

## Overview

This presentation explains:

1. **What money actually is** - fiat currency and how money actually works
2. **Government vs. private sector** - why the currency issuer is fundamentally different
3. **The role of taxation** - what taxes actually do (it's not funding spending)
4. **Debt and deficits** - the private sector's savings explained
5. **The lie and its costs** - why the myth persists and what it costs us
6. **A better future** - the questions we should be asking
