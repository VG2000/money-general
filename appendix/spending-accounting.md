# Appendix B: Government Spending Accounting

## Table 1: Accounting Transactions When Government Spends

This table shows the step-by-step balance sheet changes when Parliament authorizes Â£100 of expenditure and it flows to the private sector.

### Overview

When the UK government spends, money is created through balance sheet expansion. No pre-existing funds are required â€” the Consolidated Fund provides a sovereign line of credit backed by Parliament's taxing power.

---

### Step 1: Parliament Authorizes Expenditure

Parliament passes legislation (Supply and Appropriation Act or specific statute) authorizing Â£100 to be drawn from the Consolidated Fund.

*No balance sheet changes yet â€” this is legal authorization only.*

---

### Step 2: Treasury Requisition & Comptroller Grants Credit

HM Treasury raises a requisition. The Comptroller and Auditor General verifies Parliamentary authority and grants Treasury a "credit" on the Consolidated Fund.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Consolidated Fund** | | +Â£100 (credit to CF Supply Account) |
| **CF Supply Account** | +Â£100 (credit from CF) | |

*The CF account starts at zero but can go negative â€” this is the "growing produce of the Fund."*

---

### Step 3: Transfer to Departmental Account

Funds move from CF Supply Account to the spending department's account within the Government Banking Service.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **CF Supply Account** | âˆ’Â£100 | |
| **Departmental Account** | +Â£100 | |

*Internal transfer within government â€” no money created yet.*

---

### Step 4: Department Pays Recipient (e.g., NHS pays supplier)

The department instructs payment to a private sector recipient. This is where money enters the private sector.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Departmental Account** | âˆ’Â£100 | |
| **Paymaster General Account** | +Â£100 then âˆ’Â£100 | |
| **Bank of England** | | +Â£100 (commercial bank reserves) |
| **Commercial Bank** | +Â£100 (reserves at BoE) | +Â£100 (customer deposit) |
| **Recipient** | +Â£100 (bank deposit) | |

---

### Step 5: End of Day â€” Exchequer Sweep

At day's end, all Government Banking Service accounts are swept to zero. Net balances consolidate to the National Loans Fund.

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Consolidated Fund** | | âˆ’Â£100 (net position) |
| **National Loans Fund** | +Â£100 (claim on CF) | |

---

### Net Result

After government spends Â£100:

| Sector | Balance Sheet Change |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Government (consolidated)** | +Â£100 liability (deposit/reserves created) |
| **Bank of England** | +Â£100 liability (reserves) |
| **Commercial Bank** | +Â£100 asset (reserves), +Â£100 liability (deposit) |
| **Private Sector Recipient** | +Â£100 asset (bank deposit) |

**Key insight:** Â£100 of new money now exists in the economy that didn't exist before. The government's "debt" is the private sector's financial asset.

---

### The "Growing Produce" Mechanism

The Finance Act 1954, Section 34(3) states:

> "Any sum charged by any Act, whenever passed, on the Consolidated Fund shall be charged also on **the growing produce of the Fund**"

This connects current spending to future tax revenues. Expenditure is credit advanced on the security of Parliament's power to tax â€” not spending of pre-collected taxes.

---

## Simplified Summary (as presented in *The Money Myth*)

The presentation distils the above into four steps for a general audience:

1. **Parliament votes** to approve spending estimates via the Budget and Appropriation Acts
2. **Spending is authorised** — departments receive legal authority to access the Consolidated Fund
3. **Money is created** — the Bank of England credits accounts; new money enters the economy
4. **Taxes collected later** drain some of that money back, reducing the money supply

> "Every Budget, bank bailout, war and Covid relief scheme was provisioned by being voted into existence by MPs — not funded by prior tax collections."

This simplified sequence maps to Steps 1–5 above but omits the intermediate institutional detail (C&AG verification, GBS transfers, Exchequer Sweep) for clarity.
