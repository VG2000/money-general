# Appendix C: Taxation Accounting

## Table 2: Accounting Transactions When Tax Is Paid

This table shows the step-by-step balance sheet changes when a UK taxpayer pays £100 in tax. Taxation is the reverse of spending — it **destroys money** rather than funding expenditure.

### Overview

When taxes are paid, money flows from the private sector back to government, ultimately crediting the Consolidated Fund. This extinguishes the money that was created when government originally spent.

### Step 1: Taxpayer Instructs Payment

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Taxpayer** | −£100 (bank deposit) | −£100 (tax liability settled) |
| **Commercial Bank** | | −£100 (customer deposit) |

---

### Step 2: Commercial Bank Settles with Bank of England

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Commercial Bank** | −£100 (reserves at BoE) | |
| **Bank of England** | | −£100 (reserve liabilities) |
| **Bank of England** | | +£100 (HMRC account) |
| **HMRC Account at BoE** | +£100 | |

---

### Step 3: HMRC Transfers to Consolidated Fund

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **HMRC Account** | −£100 | |
| **Consolidated Fund** | +£100 (credit) | |

---

### Step 4: End of Day — Exchequer Sweep

| Entity | Assets | Liabilities |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **National Loans Fund** | −£100 (reduced claim on CF) | |
| **Consolidated Fund** | | +£100 (improved net position) |

---

### Net Result

| Sector | Balance Sheet Change |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Taxpayer** | −£100 asset (bank deposit gone) |
| **Commercial Bank** | −£100 asset (reserves), −£100 liability (deposit) |
| **Bank of England** | −£100 net liability |
| **Government (consolidated)** | −£100 liability (money destroyed) |

**Key insight:** £100 of money has been destroyed. Taxation removes money from circulation — it is the reverse of spending, which creates money.

### Why Taxes Don't "Fund" Spending

1. **Government spends first** — creating new money via Consolidated Fund credit
2. **Taxes are paid later** — destroying money, crediting the CF
3. **Net position calculated at day's end** — the Exchequer Sweep reconciles

The CF starts each day at zero. Spending occurs via credit (balance sheet expansion). Tax receipts arrive throughout the day. Settlement happens at day's end.

### Analogy: The Stadium Ticket

A football club issues its own tickets for entry. It doesn't need to collect tickets before issuing them — it creates tickets, people use them, then the club collects and destroys them at the gate.

- Government **issues** money (spending)
- Public **uses** money (transactions)
- Government **collects and destroys** money (taxation)
