# Glossary of Key Terms

## Foundational Concepts

### Fiat Currency
A currency that has value by government decree (*fiat* is Latin for "it shall be"), not because it is backed by or convertible into a physical commodity such as gold. The pound sterling has been a fiat currency since the UK left the gold standard in 1931. All major currencies became fully fiat after the US ended Bretton Woods convertibility in 1971.

### Gold Standard
A monetary system in which the value of currency is directly linked to gold. The UK operated under a gold standard until 1931; the last global link (via the US dollar) was severed in 1971 when the Bretton Woods system ended.

### Bretton Woods System
The post-WWII international monetary system (1944–1971) under which currencies were pegged to the US dollar, itself convertible to gold at $35/oz. Its collapse ended any commodity backing for major currencies.

### Currency Issuer vs. Currency User
The fundamental distinction in public finance. The currency issuer (UK government via Parliament) creates money by spending and destroys it via taxation. Currency users (households, businesses, local councils) must earn or borrow before spending and can genuinely run out of money. Confusing these two produces the "household budget" fallacy.

### Sectoral Balances
An accounting identity: the government sector balance + private sector balance + rest-of-world balance = zero. A government deficit is identically equal to the non-government sector's surplus. If the government runs a surplus, the private sector must run a deficit of exactly the same amount.

## Money Types

### Central Bank Money
Money issued by the Bank of England. Includes:
- **Currency** (banknotes and coins) â€” held by the public
- **Reserves** â€” deposits held by commercial banks at the Bank of England

### Commercial Bank Money
Deposits in commercial bank accounts. Created when banks make loans. Comprises approximately 97% of UK broad money.

### Broad Money
The total money supply in the economy, including both currency and bank deposits. Measured by aggregates like M4.

## UK Government Institutions

### Consolidated Fund (CF)
The central government account established in 1787. All authorized expenditure originates from the CF, and most revenue flows into it. Functions as a sovereign line of credit backed by Parliament's taxing power.

### National Loans Fund (NLF)
Handles government borrowing and lending operations. Receives the net balance from the daily Exchequer Sweep.

### Contingencies Fund
A fund (maximum Â£2 billion) for urgent expenditure when Parliament is not sitting. Must be repaid from subsequent Supply votes.

### National Savings & Investments (NS&I)
Government-backed savings provider. NS&I products (including premium bonds) are direct lending to the government — they form part of the national "debt." As of 2022, NS&I held approximately £207 billion from 25 million savers, representing roughly 8.5% of UK government debt.

### Debt Management Account (DMA)
Operated by the Debt Management Office (DMO) for daily cash management operations.

### Government Banking Service (GBS)
The banking infrastructure providing accounts for government departments, operated within the commercial banking sector but with special arrangements through the Paymaster General Account.

### Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG)
Head of the National Audit Office. Must verify Parliamentary authority before granting Treasury a "credit" on the Consolidated Fund. An essential constitutional safeguard.

## Bank of England Terms

### Reserves
Deposits held by commercial banks in their accounts at the Bank of England. Used for settlement between banks and with government.

### Ways and Means Accounts
Overdraft facilities that allow Treasury to borrow from the Bank of England. The original Ways and Means account was frozen at Â£370 million due to Maastricht Treaty constraints; a second facility (Ways and Means II) was created as a workaround.

### Sterling Monetary Framework
The Bank of England's system for implementing monetary policy, managing reserves, and providing liquidity to the banking sector.

### Floor System
Post-2009 monetary policy framework where the Bank of England holds large quantities of reserves (from QE) and pays interest on all reserves at Bank Rate. Contrasts with the pre-2009 "corridor" system.

### Corridor System
Pre-2009 monetary policy framework where the BoE targeted a specific quantity of reserves to maintain the interbank rate. Required active management of reserve levels through debt issuance and money market operations.

## Policy Terms

### Full Funding Rule
The convention that government must issue debt (gilts) equal to its borrowing requirement. A policy choice, not an operational necessity.

### Quantitative Easing (QE)
Bank of England purchases of government bonds (gilts) from the private sector, creating new reserves. Effectively reverses government debt issuance.

### Gilt
UK government bonds â€” debt securities issued by the Debt Management Office.

### Exchequer Sweep
The daily process where all Government Banking Service accounts are swept to zero, with net balances consolidated into the National Loans Fund.

---

## Accounting Terms

### Balance Sheet Expansion
Creating new assets and liabilities simultaneously, increasing the size of a balance sheet. How both commercial banks (lending) and government (spending) create money.

### T-Account
A simplified accounting format showing assets on the left and liabilities on the right. Used to illustrate balance sheet changes.

### Standing Services
Government expenditures permanently authorized by specific Acts of Parliament (e.g., debt interest payments). Don't require annual votes.

### Supply Services
Government expenditures authorized through annual Supply and Appropriation Acts passed by Parliament.

---

## Economic Concepts

### Money Multiplier
The textbook theory that banks "multiply up" central bank reserves into deposits. The Bank of England explicitly states this is not how money creation works in reality.

### Intermediation
The idea that banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Another misconception â€” banks create deposits when lending, rather than lending out existing deposits.

### Reflux
The return of money to its issuer. For commercial banks, loan repayment destroys the deposits that lending created. For government, taxation destroys the money that spending created.

### Hierarchy of Money
The concept that different forms of money exist in a hierarchy of acceptability. Government money (backed by taxing power) sits at the top; commercial bank money is convertible into government money on demand.

### National "Debt"
The cumulative total of all previous government deficits — i.e., all government spending that was not taxed back. Held by the private sector as financial assets: gilt holdings by pension funds (~£390bn), NS&I savings (~£207bn), and other government securities. More accurately described as "the private sector's savings" than as a debt burden.

### Deficit
The amount by which government spending exceeds taxation in a given period. A government deficit creates a matching private sector surplus (see Sectoral Balances). The deficit adds net financial assets to the non-government sector.

### Inflation (as spending constraint)
The primary real constraint on government spending. Occurs when aggregate demand exceeds the economy's productive capacity — too much money chasing too few goods and services. Distinguished from the false constraint of "affordability" in monetary terms.

### Productive Capacity
The economy's real ability to supply goods and services: trained workers, physical materials, infrastructure, and supply chains. The true limit on what government can provision, as opposed to monetary affordability.
